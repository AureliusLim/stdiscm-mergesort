## Features

- **Multithreaded Sorting**: Leverages multiple threads to perform merge sort operations in parallel, reducing overall sorting time.
- **Random Array Generation**: Generates a random array of specified size for sorting.
- **Performance Measurement**: Calculates and displays the time taken to sort the array.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., G++, Clang)
- C++11 Standard Library
